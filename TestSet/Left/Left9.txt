Dismantling the House of Liberal Academia
There’s a reason disputes like what happened to the college presidents are becoming more and more common.

The most disastrous congressional testimony of the past year was delivered, perhaps surprisingly, by the presidents of MIT, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania last week. All three presidents attempted to answer questions about their institutions’ speech policies, in response to inadequate responses to growing campus antisemitism in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. The presidents did make statements at the start of the hearings condemning antisemitism. But they also should have known that it’s decontextualized moments, not the totality of hours of testimony, that tend to go viral. And instead of responding to questions about calls for genocide with clear denunciations, they instead offered up stiff replies, moderate defenses of free speech, and legalistic statements about their own abhorrence of certain terms. They walked into carefully laid traps—traps that should have been visible in advance, even from ivory towers.

That’s the headline, anyway: that this blowup is about liberal hypocrisy, and that this spectacular, visible failure raises the question of whether Jewish students can feel safe on campus. But as important as these concerns are, this story is less about hypocrisy or safety than power: Fundamentally, it’s about education-hostile conservatives who resent not having as much power as they once did, about what they’re doing to get it, and about what they plan to do with it.

There is a reason this is happening now. Broad right-wing attacks on higher education, of which these hearings are a part, stem from decades of ever-more-diverse student bodies that have produced more diversity among professors and administrators than ever before. This diversity of human beings has led to a much wider diversity of views, experiences, and, yes, speech. That has, in turn, been met with a right-wing effort to undermine institutions of higher learning, shut down speech those conservatives dislike, and call into question the broader liberal project of pluralism, free expression, and intellectual inquiry. In this particular instance, it feels like it has gone through the looking glass, because conservatives have latched onto a legitimate issue that many liberals and moderates care about—antisemitism—and are cannily exploiting it, using the language of liberalism to push a profoundly illiberal agenda.

It seems relevant to mention here that all three of the presidents who testified were women. This is fairly unusual. Sally Kornbluth is only the second woman to hold that role at MIT. Claudine Gay is the second woman to preside over Harvard, and the first Black American to do so. UPenn has a longer history of gender diversity in its top role, but only about 30 percent of the presidents of America’s major research universities are women, and those low numbers have shown incredible growth recently: Just a few years ago, it was less than a quarter.

This rise reflects the radical increase in the numbers of female college students, and then of women with college degrees making their way into the top echelons of campus life. The proportion of students of color has also gone up dramatically in the past few decades. As a greater diversity of students have graduated, and as some have stayed in the academy and found work as professors and administrators, campus cultures have changed, too. We see this in departments and student majors (gender studies, ethnic studies, etc.) and in campus organizations (pro-choice groups, LGBTQ+ groups, racial and religious affinity groups, etc.). We also see it in coursework, as the literary canon expands well beyond dead white men. In response, some conservatives like to complain that colleges have abandoned their grounding in Enlightenment values when in fact what happened is an extension of those same values (inquiry into the unknown and less-known, the pursuit and expansion of knowledge, a refusal to atrophy).

I minored in women’s and gender studies as an undergraduate at New York University; as a law student at the same institution, I took courses in feminist jurisprudence and women’s rights in Islamic law. A decade and a half later, I returned to NYU to teach an undergraduate course on gender and journalism. Which is to say, I am a product of this shift, a beneficiary of it, and a catalyst for a new generation of students to inherit it. And in my experience, a more varied population on campuses has led to more varied conversations in the classroom, more interesting responses to readings and assignments, more thoughtful and creative professors, and more dynamism, innovation, and sense of purpose from students after graduation.

At least generally. There is also some conflict and, sometimes, major missteps. More people coming into once-rarified spaces from radically different backgrounds has transformed campus cultures from sounding like harmonious choruses to more discordant cacophonies, often accompanied by pitched power struggles about what a place is supposed to be: who should be there, what’s permissible, which cultural norms should dictate.

And those discussions can quickly turn poisonous when students are targeted or disrespected for who they are. Until very recently, many students were explicitly told that they didn’t belong in these very institutions: Yale didn’t admit its first group of Black students until the 1960s. Columbia didn’t admit women until 1983. Earlier (but not much!), elite colleges including Harvard worried about “the Jewish problem” of too many Jews on campus and in the 1920s adjusted their admissions policies to maintain the Old Harvard and discriminate against these newcomers. And when students who weren’t white, Christian, or male did make their way onto college campuses, they weren’t exactly welcomed with open arms. The very concept of sexual harassment as a form of gender discrimination was pioneered by feminist law students in the 1970s precisely because they were so badly harassed, including by their own professors. The idea that all students deserved to be safe on campus and free from harassment, threats, and mistreatment came to be precisely because so many students—largely women, students of color, and others who had traditionally been shut out of higher education—were harassed, threatened, and mistreated on college campuses.

As campuses became more diverse, so too, predictably, did debates over what constitutes harassment and mistreatment. Demands to draw new lines when it comes to offensive or hateful speech grew louder too. I’m skipping over a whole lot of history here for word count purposes, but in recent years, students have generated plenty of headlines about free speech on campus themselves, usually by shutting down speakers who espoused bigoted ideas or demanding that administrations take action against a speaker or an idea. They often justified these acts by arguing that certain speakers posed a danger to students or made them feel unsafe, or that certain ideas should be unwelcome on campus; they have also succeeded in getting professors let go, investigated, or admonished; art censored; and courses canceled. Much of the time, they have deployed arguments that hinge on allegations of emotional harmfulness and student well-being. In response, administrations have prioritized belonging and inclusion, and at times also emphasized emotional safety over the challenges of deep intellectual inquiry—even caving when the means the students used to demonstrate their point were profoundly illiberal, or their demands unreasonable.

Many of these stories have been reported as examples of “cancel culture” run amok or students displaying catastrophic oversensitivity. Just as often, though, they are the manifestation of debates about power: contests for who has it, and who can most effectively wield it to demand that their morals and values should determine the outer bounds of permissible speech.

Where bad speech segues into bad acts that impede students’ right to fair treatment and education itself is not always a clear line. Professors and administrators have often struggled to balance the long-held core values of educational institutions—academic freedom, maximal free expression, inquiry even into the ugly and uncomfortable—with the necessary cultural changes brought about by more diverse student bodies. Sometimes, though, the professors and administrators who are supposed to be the adults in the room seemed to lose sight of their obligation to maintain those core values so that their campuses could remain firm containers for student exploration, including furious debate over which values should govern. In doing so—in confirming that institutional values and even rules are malleable if students only get angry enough—administrators opened their institutions up to the fiasco we’re seeing today.

Conservatives, long intent on dismantling public education and tarring colleges as liberal indoctrination centers, have been on a yearslong campaign to exploit these mistakes. On occasion, they make fair points: Some college administrators have overreached. A commitment to fighting racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination has sometimes devolved into censoriousness. Many college students really don’t agree that free speech is more important than people feeling included in a space many think of as home, even if it is a temporary one.

What conservatives aren’t doing when they point out these failures, though, is trying to strengthen educational institutions. Instead, they are undermining them. Their efforts—the obsession with “cancel culture,” the cynical wielding of free speech concerns, and, now, the congressional humiliation of college presidents under the guise of wanting to keep students safe on campus—are part of their larger assaults on higher education, a more diverse and secular America, and even learning itself.

Which is why it’s not a coincidence that the three college presidents who have so raised conservative ire are female. There has been a little-discussed but growing strain of right-wing thought that identifies women as the problem with college today. Slate’s Rebecca Schuman wrote about this dynamic at length, and her persuasive analysis is absolutely necessary for understanding this moment. The overrepresentation of women on college campuses, the theory goes, has “feminized” those campuses, resulting in students (and professors) who are “united by the concepts of victim identity and of trauma,” as conservative writer Heather Mac Donald put it. The student mental health crisis? The fault of this feminized school culture that obsesses over triggers and is more interested in picking through one’s emotional life than engaging in an intellectual one.

One of the chief proponents of this theory is Christopher Rufo, a far-right activist who has made a career of profoundly dishonest but often highly effective attacks on “critical race theory,” diversity training programs, and LGBTQ+ rights. He was a force behind Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill that in fact radically constrains free speech. His goal is to undermine public and higher education, and certainly to push women out of it. After he was appointed to the board of the once-respected New College of Florida, he pledged to boost offerings for men because too many women “caused all sorts of cultural problems” and created “what many have called a social justice ghetto.”

Many of the same conservatives who attack higher education are also no fans of public K–12 education either. Republicans have successfully cut educational funding, attacked teachers unions, and siphoned money from public schools to private religious institutions (often with appallingly low academic standards). The goal is not encouraging universities to focus less on DEI and more on STEM. It’s destruction of or dominance over American education, so that right-wing values can be imposed.

This makes for a very asymmetrical playing field. When conservatives criticize liberals for free speech violations, many of us take that to heart. When the criticisms are reversed, though, who cares? Conservatives have largely used free speech concerns as a means for curbing what they see as liberal dominance in higher education; it does not necessarily follow that free speech is the desired ends—as evidenced by most of the educational institutions over which conservatives have control. Indeed, the same conservatives who style themselves free speech warriors have long been willing to embrace far more radical anti-speech laws and rules than the elite academic institutions they so despise. Republicans have proposed more than 70 pieces of legislation restricting what educators and students can say. The U.S. colleges that most stringently regulate student speech are the conservative Christian ones. Yes, these are private institutions, but so are the Ivies—and yet only the latter would face a huge backlash if, say, they refused to allow an anti-abortion speaker on campus, or barred students from joining a campus pro-life group. At private religious colleges, advocacy for abortion rights and even expression of LGBTQ+ identity is routinely barred. No one bats an eye—instead, we just seem to expect it.

This context should help us to see last week’s college president congressional testimony in a different light. Because, sure, conservatives who complain about liberal hypocrisy on the question of anti-Israel speech are disingenuous. But they’re not entirely wrong. For years, many progressives have argued that impact, not intent, should be the primary consideration when discussing offensive speech, and that marginalized groups targeted by that speech should be the ones who draw the lines. That is now more complicated as some Jewish students are saying anti-Israel speech—and especially phrases like “from the river to the sea,” which many believe means an end to the state of Israel and the expulsion or murder of millions—is hateful and makes them feel unsafe, whatever the speaker’s intent. The college presidents are right that context does matter here, and speech on campus should be as free as possible. But it’s reasonable to wonder why that line-drawing is happening now, after years of allowing significant encroachment into free expression, often in the name of student safety and inclusion.

By the same token, though, it’s reasonable to ask why conservatives are now so willing to jump on the inclusion-and-student-safety bandwagon. The answer is that they want power and dominance over the spaces in which young people learn to think, because they want the unfettered ability to tell young people what to think. By bending on free speech principles, liberals have unfortunately given them an opening.

The congressional hearings were something of a role reversal, and not just insofar as both sides were plenty hypocritical. Conservatives like Rufo have argued that women outnumbering men in college, and more women in positions of power in academia, are feminizing forces that have taken education away from what we see as rigorous and rational and into what we consider the emotional (as if white men long demanding the exclusion of women, Jews, and racial minorities was a rational logic-brain reaction, rather than an objectively hysterical response, but I digress). And yet in the hearings, the three female college presidents approached their inquisitors with the precise kind of analytic, careful language so often coded as masculine. It was the conservatives who leaned on the language of “moral clarity,” bullying, harassment, and ensuring that students “feel safe and welcome.”

That strategy was incredibly effective, and we can except to see more of it. Among the best-known lines from Black feminist writer Audre Lorde, whom I first read as an undergraduate in one of many gender studies classes, is the observation that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” Conservatives who want to eviscerate modern education are taking a version of this strategy in the short term: use progressive tools and the language and values of liberalism to chip away at these grand institutions of liberalism. I suspect, though, that they’ll bring their own bulldozers to finish the job.
