Ramaswamy Battles CNN Over Whether January 6 Riot Was An ‘Inside Job’

Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy battled with CNN’s Abby Phillip during a Wednesday night town hall on the network over remarks that he has made about the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.

Phillip asked Ramaswamy about remarks that he made at the most recent Republican presidential primary debate when he suggested that the riot was an inside job.

“The next day, Capitol rioter Alan Hostetter highlighted your comments at his sentencing,” she said. “He is going to prison for 11 years. Hostetter threatened members of Congress. He brought a hatchet, knives, pepper spray, stun batons, tactical gear to the U.S. Capitol.”

“Are you concerned that a convicted felon like that is now promoting your comments in court?” she asked.

Ramaswamy responded by saying that before he became a political candidate, he was “just consuming passive media,” and that in the past, he would have labeled any talk about January 6 being “an inside job” as “crazy talk, fringe conspiracy theory nonsense.”

“I can tell you now, having gone somewhat deep in this, it’s not,” he said. “I mean, the reality is this. We do have a government, first of all, we have technology, that has lied to us systematically over the last several years about the origin of COVID-19, about the Hunter Biden laptop that we were told was false by 51 CIA experts and otherwise, before we now know that it was true.”

“You can go straight down the list, the Trump-Russia disinformation collusion hoax, all of it,” he continued. “Now we come to January 6. The reality is, we know that there were federal law enforcement agents in that field. We don’t know how many.”

The two proceeded to battle it out over the topic for the next several minutes.
